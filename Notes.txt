CDN - Content Delivery Network


Responsive Breakpoints

@media - Media quirry lets you apply specific CSS rules depending on the size of the window.

Depends on devices minimum width

    @media(min-width:576px) - small screens 'sm' breakpoint
    @media(min-width:768px) - medium screens 'md' breakpoint
    @media(min-width:992px) - large screens 'lg' breakpoint
    @media(min-width:1200px) - extra large screens 'xl' breakpoint

Grid System

    NOTE - Rows are limited to 12 columns

    Containers - think of them like tables: with headers rows and columns 

    Container  - root of Grid
    Container class - large gutters
    Container-fluid class - smaller gutters

    Row elements - group items horizontaly across page and Manage columns
    Rows manage horizontal alighnment
    col elements - inside rows

    Class col-<number of columns>; - shorthand for specifying how many columns should be in a row

    Col-auto; column automatically adjust to content

    Verticle alignment

    The folowing code specifies verticle column alignment within a row.

    align-items-start - aligns columns to the top of a row
    align-items-center - aligns columns to the middle of a row
    align-items-end - aligns columns to the bottom of a row
    
    Self alignment

    align-self - Much like the other alignment options, align-self gives you control of the individual columns vertical position within a row.

    Example - <div class="col align-self-start"> column will be at the top of the row

    Breakpoints

        Breakpoints determine what happens to elements when the screen is a certain size or its orientation changes.

        The example below will cause the column to take the space of 5 columns at the lm or 768px breakpoint and 576px at the sm breakpoint

        <div class="col-lm-5 col-xl-3">

Offset columns

    The offset property lets you position columns within a row.
    Using an offset with a breakpoint lets you control what happens to that column on different screens.

    Breakpoints are not required when using an offset

    <div class="col-sm-3 offset-sm-3">

Forms

    form-group - Bootstrap keyword for grouping form items (label, input etc.)
        div class="form-group"

        form-control - gives the form basic visual styling provided by bootstrap

        input type="text" class="form-control"

Form Grid

    form-row - 

    <div class="form-row"> - putting your forms into

Input Group
        
        Important! The use of "sm" here does not corrolate to screensize

        input-group-sm, md, lg, xl - use this on a group of inputs to shrink or increase their verticle size slightly.

        input-group-prepend - used to attach text to the end any element
        input-group-append - used to attach text to the beginning any element
